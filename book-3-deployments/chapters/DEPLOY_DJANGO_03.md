# Step 3: Installing Required Packages for Deployment

Make sure the virtual environment for your project is activated in your terminal. Once it, install the following packages.

```sh
pipenv install gunicorn dj-database-url psycopg2-binary
```

If you used Poetry to create your virtual environment, the command is...

```sh
poetry add gunicorn dj-database-url psycopg2-binary
```

At this point, make sure you add, commit, and push all changes to your Github repo.
